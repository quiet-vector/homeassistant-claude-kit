# Setup Infrastructure

This skill configures the mechanical layer: HA API connectivity, SSH access, and
initial config pull. It is **idempotent** — run it any time to verify or repair the
connection without affecting your actual configuration.

## Step 1: Data Consent & Privacy Mode

**Only ask once per session.** If the user already consented during an earlier invocation
of this skill in the same conversation, skip this step entirely.

**1a. Data consent** — Before reading any Home Assistant data, inform the user:

> "This skill will connect to your Home Assistant instance and read your entity registry,
> automation configs, and documentation files. This data is sent to Anthropic's API as
> part of this Claude conversation. See PRIVACY.md for full details.
> Continue? (yes / no)"

If the user says no, stop here and explain they can still use the repo manually.

**1b. Privacy mode offer** — Only ask if consent was given. Only ask once per session.

First check if privacy mode is already active: `test -f .claude/privacy-patterns`. If it is,
say "Privacy mode is already enabled" and skip the offer.

If not active, ask:

> "Would you like to enable privacy mode? This blocks Claude from directly reading your
> credentials, personal data files, and runtime state. Setup still works — shell commands
> handle connectivity. You can toggle this later with `make privacy-on` / `make privacy-off`.
> Enable privacy mode? (yes / no)"

If yes: `cp .claude/privacy-patterns.example .claude/privacy-patterns`
If no: proceed without it.

## Step 2: Check .env

Check whether `.env` exists in the repo root:

```bash
test -f .env && echo "exists" || echo "missing"
```

**If missing:** Tell the user to copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HA_TOKEN` | Long-lived access token (HA → Profile → Security → Long-Lived Access Tokens) | `eyJ...` |
| `HA_URL` | Your HA URL (local or remote) | `http://homeassistant.local:8123` |
| `HA_HOST` | SSH hostname, IP, or SSH config alias | `homeassistant.local` or `ha` |
| `SSH_USER` | SSH add-on user (usually `root`) | `root` |
| `HA_REMOTE_PATH` | Remote config directory (see note below) | `/config/` or `/homeassistant/` |
| `VITE_GO2RTC_URL` | go2rtc URL (camera streams) — leave empty if not using cameras | `http://homeassistant.local:1984` |

> **HA_REMOTE_PATH note:** HA OS with the SSH add-on typically uses `/homeassistant/`,
> while HA Container/Supervised uses `/config/`. If unsure, the SSH test in Step 4 will
> auto-detect the correct path.

**IMPORTANT:** The `.env` file must NOT use inline comments on value lines (e.g.
`HA_HOST=foo  # comment`). Makefile's `include` treats everything after `=` as the value,
including `# ...` text. Use only full-line comments (lines starting with `#`).

Wait for the user to fill in `.env` before continuing.

**If exists and privacy mode is OFF:** Load the values and proceed.

**If exists and privacy mode is ON** (`test -f .claude/privacy-patterns`):
Tell the user: "Privacy mode is active — I can't read `.env` directly. Please verify it
has `HA_TOKEN`, `HA_URL`, `HA_HOST`, `SSH_USER` filled in. The next step will validate
your connection." Then proceed to Step 3 — the curl test validates the values work via
`source .env` (shell sourcing is intentionally not blocked by privacy mode).

## Step 3: Validate HA API Token

Test the HA API is reachable:

```bash
source .env && curl -sf -H "Authorization: Bearer $HA_TOKEN" "$HA_URL/api/" | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print('HA version:', d.get('version','unknown'))"
```

- **Success:** Print the HA version and continue.
- **Failure:** Show the curl error. Common fixes:
  - Token expired → generate a new one at HA → Profile → Security
  - Wrong URL → check if HA is running, try `http://` vs `https://`
  - Network unreachable → ensure you're on the same network, or check VPN/Nabu Casa

## Step 4: Validate SSH Connectivity

Test SSH access (required for `make pull` / `make push`).

**IMPORTANT:** Always include `$SSH_USER@` in the SSH command. The `.env` has a separate
`SSH_USER` variable (usually `root`) — do NOT connect as the local macOS/Linux user.

```bash
source .env && ssh -o ConnectTimeout=5 -o BatchMode=yes "$SSH_USER@$HA_HOST" "echo ok" 2>&1
```

- **Success (`ok`):** Continue to auto-detect `HA_REMOTE_PATH`.
- **`Permission denied (publickey)`:** SSH key not authorized. Run:
  ```bash
  source .env && ssh-copy-id "$SSH_USER@$HA_HOST"
  ```
  Or manually add `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` (or `id_ed25519.pub`) to the SSH add-on's
  authorized keys in HA Settings → Add-ons → SSH & Web Terminal → Configuration.
- **`Connection refused` / `No route to host`:** SSH add-on not running or wrong hostname.
  Check HA Settings → Add-ons → SSH & Web Terminal → Start.

### Auto-detect HA_REMOTE_PATH

After SSH is confirmed working, verify that `HA_REMOTE_PATH` points to the correct directory:

```bash
source .env && ssh "$SSH_USER@$HA_HOST" "test -f ${HA_REMOTE_PATH:-/config/}configuration.yaml && echo 'PATH_OK' || echo 'PATH_WRONG'"
```

**If `PATH_WRONG`:** Try the HA OS default path:
```bash
source .env && ssh "$SSH_USER@$HA_HOST" "test -f /homeassistant/configuration.yaml && echo '/homeassistant/' || (test -f /config/configuration.yaml && echo '/config/' || echo 'NOT_FOUND')"
```

Update `HA_REMOTE_PATH` in `.env` with the correct path before proceeding. If `NOT_FOUND`,
ask the user to verify their HA configuration directory location.

## Step 5: Generate Derived .env Files

Once HA API + SSH are confirmed working, generate the derived config files:

**`dashboard/.env.local`** (Vite dev server + runtime):
```bash
source .env
cat > dashboard/.env.local << EOF
# AUTO-GENERATED by setup-infrastructure — do not edit manually
# Re-run the setup-infrastructure skill to regenerate.
VITE_HA_URL=$HA_URL
VITE_HA_TOKEN=$HA_TOKEN
VITE_GO2RTC_URL=$VITE_GO2RTC_URL
EOF
```

Confirm the file was written:
```bash
echo "dashboard/.env.local written"
cat dashboard/.env.local
```

## Step 6: Run make pull

Pull the current HA configuration to the local `config/` directory:

```bash
make pull
```

This syncs automations, scripts, `configuration.yaml`, and `.storage/` (entity/area registry)
from your HA instance. The `.storage/` files are used by `setup-customize` for entity discovery.

If `make pull` fails:
- Check that `HA_REMOTE_PATH` in `.env` is correct — HA OS uses `/homeassistant/`, Container uses `/config/`
- Verify SSH access in Step 4 (remember to use `$SSH_USER@$HA_HOST`)
- Check `.env` has no inline comments (breaks Makefile `include`)
- Run `make pull` manually and share the error

## Step 7: Verify Python Tooling

Check the Python validation tools work:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv 2>/dev/null || true && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -q pyyaml 2>/dev/null && python tools/yaml_validator.py config/ && echo "Validation tools OK"
```

If this fails, ensure Python 3.10+ is installed.

## Step 8: Install ha-api / ha-ws on HA

Install [claude-code-ha](https://github.com/danbuhler/claude-code-ha) CLI tools on the HA instance.
These provide `ha-api` (REST) and `ha-ws` (WebSocket) for entity management, state queries,
service calls, and entity renaming — all accessible via SSH.

```bash
source .env
# Clone path adapts to HA_REMOTE_PATH (tools live alongside configuration.yaml)
ssh "$SSH_USER@$HA_HOST" "test -d ${HA_REMOTE_PATH}claude-code-ha && echo 'ALREADY_INSTALLED' || (cd ${HA_REMOTE_PATH} && git clone https://github.com/danbuhler/claude-code-ha.git && echo 'CLONED')"
ssh "$SSH_USER@$HA_HOST" "bash ${HA_REMOTE_PATH}claude-code-ha/install.sh"
```

Verify it works:

```bash
source .env && ssh "$SSH_USER@$HA_HOST" "source /etc/profile.d/claude-ha.sh; source ${HA_REMOTE_PATH}.env; ha-api domains"
```

If this prints entity counts by domain, the tools are working.

> **Note:** HA OS updates reset the root filesystem (symlinks, pip packages). The repo
> persists at `${HA_REMOTE_PATH}claude-code-ha/` but re-run the install script after each HA OS update:
> `ssh "$SSH_USER@$HA_HOST" "bash ${HA_REMOTE_PATH}claude-code-ha/install.sh"`

## Step 9: Write setup-state.json Checkpoint

Write a checkpoint so `setup-customize` knows the infrastructure is ready:

```python
import json, datetime, os

state = {
    "schema_version": 1,
    "infrastructure": {
        "ha_url": os.environ.get("HA_URL", ""),
        "configured_at": datetime.datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "steps_completed": ["env", "token", "ssh", "pull", "venv", "ha_tools"]
    },
    "session": {
        "current_phase": "infrastructure_complete",
        "can_resume": True
    }
}
with open("setup-state.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(state, f, indent=2)
print("Checkpoint saved to setup-state.json")
```

Run this via: `source .env && python3 -c "$(cat << 'PYEOF'` ... `PYEOF`)"` — using a quoted heredoc to avoid shell expansion issues with the `.env` values.

## Completion

Tell the user:

> "Infrastructure is ready. Your HA instance is connected and config has been pulled.
>
> **Next step:** Run `setup-customize` to map your rooms and entities to the dashboard.
> Just say: 'set up my home' or 'run setup-customize'."

If the user asks about what was pulled, run `ls config/` and show the directory structure.
