## Why This Exists

**The problem with Lovelace.** It's great for quick device control, but its card model is centered around individual devices and rooms. Real home automation is more nuanced -- you don't control a boiler directly, you set a heating schedule with climate zones that don't always map 1:1 to rooms (an open-plan ground floor is one zone, not four). You want manual overrides per zone when needed, but the system should coordinate the boiler with the TRVs automatically, driven by temperature sensors. When there's spare solar power, the ACs should heat opportunistically -- again with manual override when you want it. Lovelace doesn't give you this level of control over the interface or the logic behind it.

**What made it possible.** This entire system -- 70+ automations, a custom React dashboard, validation tooling, entity management -- was built from scratch in two weeks by one person using [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code). There is no visual editor for the dashboard; it's custom React code. There is no UI for editing automations; everything lives in YAML files managed through Claude Code. You describe what you want in plain language, and the AI writes the code, validates it, deploys it, and documents it. Yes, there are risks in AI-generated code, but they are mitigated by validation at every step (pre-push hooks, TypeScript checks, entity reference validation), a structured workflow that catches issues early ([Compound Engineering](PROMPTING-GUIDE.md#6-compound-engineering-workflow)), and tight integration with HA through CLI tools that eliminate manual copy-paste and command-running.

The result outweighs the risks by far: a system that would have taken months to build manually, working exactly the way you want it, fully documented, and continuously improvable through the same AI workflow that built it.

## Design Principles

- **Use-case driven, not device-driven.** The dashboard and automations are organized around how you use your home -- climate zones, activity modes, energy management -- not around individual devices or integrations.
- **Nothing hardcoded.** Every threshold, timeout, temperature, brightness, and duration is an `input_*` helper, visible and editable in the Settings view. Automations read these at runtime -- no magic numbers, everything tweakable without touching YAML.
- **Self-documenting.** `docs/system-*.md` describes what IS (hardware, entities, design decisions -- generated during setup, populated as you build). `docs/solutions/` captures debugging lessons (34 docs and growing). Both are updated as part of every change, so documentation never drifts from reality.
- **Mobile-first.** The dashboard is designed for phones. Every interaction is touch-optimized. When a design compromise was needed, mobile experience was favored over desktop.
- **Validate before deploy.** Hooks run on every file edit. `make push` validates before syncing. Broken configs never reach HA.
- **Event-driven, not polling.** Automations use state triggers with `for:` durations, not timers or delays. The system reacts to changes rather than checking on intervals.

## Quick Start

> **You'll need:** SSH access to HA, a long-lived token, Python 3.12+, rsync -- see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for details.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dcb/homeassistant-claude-kit
cd homeassistant-claude-kit
cp .env.example .env   # Fill in HA_HOST, HA_URL, HA_TOKEN, SSH_USER
make setup             # Python venv + dependencies
```

> **Privacy:** Claude Code reads your config files to help you. This includes entity IDs,
> room names, and automation logic. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for details and how to
> enable privacy mode.

Then open Claude Code in the repo and say **"set up my home"**. That's it -- Claude handles the rest.

## How to Use This Kit

**Just talk to Claude** (most users) -- Describe what you want in plain language. Claude reads the project's [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) automatically and knows the entity naming conventions, validation rules, and deployment workflow. See the **[Prompting Guide](PROMPTING-GUIDE.md)** for examples from simple tasks to complex automations.

**Learn the patterns** (power users) -- For complex features, use the [Compound Engineering](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin) workflow: `/ce:brainstorm` to explore what to build, `/ce:plan` to design it, `/ce:work` to implement, `/ce:compound` to document the solution. Review `docs/solutions/` for known anti-patterns before starting. Read `docs/system-*.md` for your domain before modifying automations.

**Do it yourself** (manual) -- All `make` commands and YAML templates are documented. You can edit files directly, validate with `make validate`, and deploy with `make push`. Initial entity discovery and dashboard config generation are easier with Claude Code, but everything else works without it.

## What's Included

### Automation Templates

Templates in `docs/templates/config/` -- copied and customized during setup.

| Domain | File | What It Does |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Climate | `climate.yaml` | TRV zone control, adaptive preheat, day/night schedules |
| Energy | `energy.yaml` | Solar EV charging feedback loop, overnight decisions, session summaries |
| Lighting | `lighting.yaml` | Motion lights with AL integration, movie/night/work modes, porch twilight |
| Context | `context.yaml` | Mode hierarchy, notification dedup, TV sleep timers |
| Health | `health.yaml` | Integration watchdogs with retry, stale sensors, battery alerts |
| AC | `ac.yaml` | Solar-driven AC heating, manual mode bypass with auto-revert |
| Appliance | `appliance.yaml` | WiFi appliance state machine, cycle tracking, solar reminders |

### Dashboard

React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4, deployed as an HA `panel_custom` via `make deploy-dashboard`.

- Heating timeline showing boiler and per-zone activity over the day
- Per-zone temperature charts with target lines and TRV calibration offsets

- Integration health status with watchdog retry history

### Validation Tools

```bash
make validate   # Runs all three layers:
                # 1. YAML syntax validation
                # 2. Entity reference checking
                # 3. Official HA configuration validation
```

Pre-push hooks block broken configs automatically. Template placeholder IDs (`your_*`) are skipped.

### Entity Rename Skill

Batch rename HA entities to follow a consistent `domain.{room}_{descriptor}` convention:

```
entity-rename   # Discover → propose → approve → execute → verify
```

Uses `ha-ws` (WebSocket API via SSH) for renames, then updates all YAML and TypeScript references automatically. Tracks every rename in `entity-renames.json` for rollback safety.

### Institutional Knowledge

34 solution docs in `docs/solutions/` covering common HA pitfalls: Jinja2 scoping bugs, watchdog patterns, automation mode traps, dashboard timing issues, API gotchas, and more. These are automatically surfaced by the planning workflow to prevent repeating past mistakes.

## Available Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `make pull` | Pull latest config from HA |
| `make push` | Validate + push to HA + reload |
| `make diff` | Dry run -- preview what push would sync |
| `make validate` | Run all validation tests |
| `make backup` | Create timestamped backup |
| `make entities` | Explore available HA entities |
| `make deploy-dashboard` | Build + deploy React dashboard to HA |

## Architecture

Configuration flows through an rsync-based pipeline:

1. **Edit locally** -- YAML files in `config/`, React components in `dashboard/`
2. **Validate** -- hooks run on every file edit (YAML syntax, entity refs, TypeScript)
3. **Push** -- `make push` syncs to HA via rsync over SSH (`.storage/` is protected)
4. **Reload** -- automations, scripts, and templates reload without HA restart

The dashboard is a standalone React app served as a `panel_custom` iframe. It connects to HA via WebSocket (embedded auth when in HA, token auth in dev mode).
